# Möbius
Studio Möbius | Landscape designer, spatial thinker, and systems creative. Working at the intersection of ecology, memory, and simulation — where design meets meaning. I am Möbius

# Möbius

**Spatial thinker. Systems creative. Cartographer of memory, entropy, and simulation.**

Welcome to Möbius — a studio, a signal, a mindset.  
This is where design folds in on itself and comes out the other side transformed.

At Möbius, we work in the space between:  
between ecology and abstraction,  
between land and code,  
between what you see and what it meant to be.

## What You'll Find Here

This repository is a living archive of experimental design, mapping, and meaning-making. Expect:

- Conceptual Cartography – terrain maps that speak memory, not just elevation  
- Landscape Code – QGIS and GIS-powered scripts for place-based design  
- Entropy Studies – tools and writings exploring decay, time, and the simulation of nature  
- Fragments & Prototypes – work-in-progress pieces, open for reflection or remix

## Why Möbius?

Because we don’t walk straight lines.  
We loop. We question. We return — changed.  
Like the Möbius strip, this studio exists on a surface with only one side: the one that connects.

## Threads of Influence

Landscape, entropy, simulation theory, posthumanism, neurodiversity, memory...  
This isn’t just code — it’s philosophy with an undo button.  
A defiant space for those who don’t quite fit the grid.
